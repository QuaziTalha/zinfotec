Display: Small pitch and closer viewing distance. the use of high-quality three SMD lamps, the horizontal and vertical angle of 130 degrees,
light mixing uniformity, color matching degree is high, good consistency, clearer display true, fully meet the needs of outdoor display
Energy consumption: Using 4.5 switching power supply, saving 10% of power consumption. Actively respond to the national energy
conservation and emission reduction policies
The mask has been designed with precision calculation of the striped fabric, which greatly reduces the light emission caused by the ambient
light reflection problem The bottom shell adopts the stiffener design of the proposed engineering mechanics to enhance the load-bearing
capacity and improve the overall flatness of the product thus making outdoor Q series product free of limitation of displaying square.
Protection: The front side uses dedicated thermal potting silicone, the back side protected with three anti-paint protection, making it double
waterproof protected resulting in more better weather protection and faster heat-cooling. Unique drainage hole design, reduces the steel
structure defects caused seepage of water into the module breakage caused by structure thus improving the module's protective capabilities
and prolonging its lifespan.
Use:compared to the other outdoor direct color products, outdoor Q series products are more lightweight and easy for assembly,
transportation and maintenance thus bringing convenience and time-saving.
